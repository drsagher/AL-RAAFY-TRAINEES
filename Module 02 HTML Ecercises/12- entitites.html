    <h1>HTML Entities</h1>
    <p>Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.</p>
    <p>Some characters are reserved in HTML.
    If you use the less than  &lt; or greater than  &gt; signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.  
    Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
    A character entity looks like this:</p>
    <!-- A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;
        A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line. -->
    <p>Hello, &nbsp;&nbsp;World</p>

    
    <!-- HTML Symbol Entities -->
    <p>I will display &euro;</p>
    <p>I will display &#8364;</p>
    <p>I will display &#x20AC;</p>

    <!-- Using Emojis in HTML -->
    <!-- Emojis are characters from the UTF-8 character set: 😄 😍 💗 -->
    <!-- Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not.
        They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set. -->
    <p>I will display A B C</p>
    <p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p>
    <p style="font-size:48px">
